Hello

Hello it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya but I ain't done much healing
Hello can you hear me
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello how are you
It's so typical of me to talk about myself
I'm sorry I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened
It's no secret
That the both of us are running out of time
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooooohh anymore
Ooooohh anymore
Ooooohh anymore
Anymore
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore [14]

你好吗 是我
我犹豫着要不要给你来电，我不确定多年之后的今日你是否还愿意见我
是否愿意来闲聊寒暄，细数从前
人们都说时间能治愈一切，但似乎这说法不怎么适合我
嘿 你在听吗
我会梦到从前，美好的加州 美好的我们
当时那么年轻，向往自由的我们
我都快要忘了，但现实却让一切重现眼前
我们之间的差距愈见明显
有如天差地别
我还是想打给你，即使相隔天边
即使打上千遍万遍我也想给你来电
对我从前所有的一切，说声抱歉
但似乎我每次来电，都是忙音不断，没人接
但这相隔千里的来电
至少能让我不留遗憾，告诉你我的想念
我想说我伤了你的心，真的很抱歉
但也许值得庆幸的是，不会再有人让你悲痛欲绝
嗨 你最近还好吗
我已经习惯了自说自话帮你回答
对于过去我很抱歉，但希望你现在能好过一点
不知你是否已忘记那小城
那个除了回忆一无所有的小城
毫无悬念
我们都荒废了我们从前的时间
所以这来自远方的我的来电
即使打上千遍万遍我也想对你说
我很抱歉
对我从前所做的一切说声抱歉
但似乎我每次来电，都是忙音不断，没人接
但这相隔千里的来电
至少能让我不留遗憾，告诉你我的想念
我想说我伤了你的心，真的很抱歉
但也许值得庆幸的是
不会再有人让你悲痛欲绝
不会再有人让你悲痛欲绝
我们的过往不会再出现
这来自远方的来电，即使打上千遍万遍
我也想对你说，我很抱歉
对我从前所做的一切说声抱歉
但似乎我每次来电，都是忙音不断，没人接
但这相隔千里的来电
至少能让我不留遗憾，告诉你我的想念
我想说我伤了你的心，真的很抱歉
但也许值得庆幸的是
不会再有人让你悲痛欲绝
不会再有人像我这样让你悲痛欲绝 [15]
